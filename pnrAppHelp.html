<h2>Boston Region Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO)
Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) Park-and-
Ride and Bicycle Parking Dashboard </h2>
<h3>MBTA Park and Ride and Bicycle Parking Monitoring - Purpose </h3>
<p>
The monitoring of MBTA park-and-ride and bicycle parking is part of a larger effort of the
Congestion Management Process (CMP). The CMP is a federally mandated program that
requires a multimodal approach to monitoring traffic congestion. The Boston Region MPO’s
CMP monitors expressways, arterials, high-occupancy vehicle lanes, park-and-ride facilities,
bicycle parking facilities, and bicycle and pedestrian transportation infrastructure. This
dashboard focuses on monitoring the daily presence of parking near 152 MBTA stations, and
bicycle parking near 280 MBTA stations. For additional information, including a detailed analysis
of the systemwide park-and-ride and bicycle parking results, please click on the link to the
memoranda below.<p>

<h3>Using the Application</h3>
<p>
The main screen displays a default map of the Boston region. <p>
To use the interface: <p>
<ol>
<li>There is a choice to view the basemap using either MassGIS or Open Street Map Layer. Click the respective desired circle.
<li>Click the “Select a town or neighborhood” drop-down menu to narrow down the area of
the desired MBTA station. <i>Note, while this is not necessary, every MBTA station will be
displayed if a neighborhood or town is not selected on the next tab.</i> Once a
neighborhood or town is selected, the MBTA station options are narrowed down to the
specific neighborhood. 
<li>Click the “Select a MBTA station” drop-down tab to select a single MBTA station for
viewing. The map will zoom in to the selected station, and detailed data will be displayed
below the map in the travel network. 
<li>The “Station information” tab, located below the map, will display detailed data about the
selected MBTA station. This includes bicycle parking data and features, such as bicycle
trails, bicycle lanes, crosswalks, sidewalks, and signals near the MBTA stations. 
<li>The “Parking information” tab, located towards the bottom of the dashboard, will display
detailed data for every parking lot that MBTA commuters typically use near the MBTA
station. 
</ol></li>
<p> The bicycle parking data for 2017–18 can be downloaded in Excel format by clicking the
<i>Download Stations and Bike Data </i> button. The parking data near MBTA stations can be
downloaded in Excel format by clicking the <i>Download Parking Lot Data </i> button. </p>
